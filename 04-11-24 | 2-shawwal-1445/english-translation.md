I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.
Guide us on the Straight Path,
the path of those who have received Your grace;
not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves,
nor of those who have gone astray.

O Allah, bless our Master Muhammad and the family of our Master Muhammad, as You blessed our Master Ibrahim and the family of our Master Ibrahim. And grant peace and blessings upon our Master Muhammad and the family of our Master Muhammad, as You granted peace and blessings upon our Master Ibrahim and the family of our Master Ibrahim, in all the worlds. You are worthy of all praise and glory. Glory be to Your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, above what they describe, and peace be upon the messengers. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. 

In the name of Allah,the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

In the name of Allah.
Allah.
Allah.
Allah.
And there is no power or strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.

**Question**:
My Sheikh, as I perform the wird with closed eyes and focus in the center as you instructed me, flashes of light come to me from the right, left, above, and below. Is this the light ?

**Answer**:
Everything is light from Allah because it's all signs and indications from Allah. We focus on the center, which is the qibla "direction of prayer" to reach the example of the Divine Light. It comes from wherever it wills, as the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: 'Light to my right, light to my left, light above me, light below me.' This considered a light in non-delimitation realm. We must restrain it with reason. 'Reason it and trust.'
 for Allah, the Almighty, reasons it for us in the quaternary example. The fastest pace and behavior "sulook" is to try to surpass these directions and focus on one direction, which is the qibla "direction of the prayer" or the center. In fact, it's not the center; it's the front or your orientation.

In the story of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, Allah says: 'And I have directed my face towards He who created the heavens and the earth.' So at that moment, you receive the example directly and the matter becomes faster. Once you understand the example , do not lean towards any direction. Thus, we tell the seeker in the beginning of their journey to close their eyes to surpass and avoid these directions because you define these directions yourself, with your presence, and by looking at yourself. Therefore, the Lord says, 'And remember your Lord when you forget.' If you forget yourself, remember Allah; your gonna be fast in dhikir , near , But human is accustomed to opening his eyes and seeing these directions. Even if he closes his eyes, he still senses his presence and determines. So we say close your eyes so there's no right or left, no above or below; only your direction remains. This is why we say to the seeker: close your eyes until you overcome these directions. However, for 40, 50, or 70 years, he has been defining these directions by his existence. Even if he closes his eyes, he still sees his presence and thinks he exists, so he continues to define these directions. This is the problem. As long as he defines, he imagines that it comes from the right or left, but in fact, it comes from his orientation. As long as he defines these directions, he sees right and left. We choose the center for him and say: this is your direction. All of this is his direction 'in front of him.' So Allah says in Surah Al-Hadid, 'On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right.' This is all direction; there's no longer left. This is between your hands; it is the same as your right 'sidi Sheikh raised both his arms to his side'. But this is difficult; detaching oneself from something accustomed is difficult. No one closes their eyes and surpasses these directions in their thoughts forever. Even if he's been 20 years on the path, he still closes his eyes and thinks, 'This is right, and this is left.' When you close your eyes, what do you see? As if you see a tablet, it's your direction, and that's it. But your thoughts always define. So, I come and say: search for the source.
 as long as you have a problem with yourself, a problem with the selfishness of your existence. At least swim, dive in, enter; perhaps you'll lose these directions. Clear?"

**Question**:

It's known that Surah Al-Baqarah is the longest chapter in the Quran. Is there a secret why our Lord named it Al-Baqarah (The Cow) and gave it this name? For example, if we see India revering the cow, and America, the world's strongest country, calling themselves cowboys.

The Pharaonic civilization also revered and glorified the cow. Is there a connection between them?

**Answer**:

You're now asking a question, but instead of keeping the question specific, when you started talking in this manner, it's like the question starts fading away. So, if you're asking about Surah Al-Baqarah as a Quranic chapter, we talk about Surah Al-Baqarah as a chapter and as Quran. But if we go beyond and talk about what happens in India or America, then Surah Al-Baqarah is no longer relevant at that moment. Clear? We start talking about a culture, an event, a religion, a thought, or a perception happening in a specific country. What do you want? Is it Surah Al-Baqarah or what's happening in India?

Disciple: But my question is whether there's a connection?

Sidi Sheikh: No, there's no connection. The connection of Surah Al-Baqarah lies within Surah Al-Baqarah itself; we don't need India or America. If we want to see America or India, we talk about the culture of a specific people. Clear on what I mean?

Disciple: Yes, clear, Sidi Sheikh.

Sidi Sheikh: So, what does Surah Al-Baqarah tell us? The story of Moses, peace be upon him, with the Children of Israel. Clear? Before the appearance of Moses, peace be upon him, and before the Torah and the Book of Allah, which is the Torah and the Tablets, among other things, they had multiple perceptions, not a single perception. This diverse perception they had was related to the magic that existed in their time. Because no prophet or messenger was sent unless his people were challenged in what they believed to be an intermediary between them and the Almighty or what they believed to be the deity. So God Almighty incapacitates His servants by his messengers until the truth shines forth So, what was the prevailing perception of Moses' people? The dominance of magic was prevalent in their perception, so the people all dealt with magic. Hence, Moses' people, meaning a specific and limited group, were bound by the practices of these magicians Understand? So, it gave a lesson to Pharaoh and his people. Pharaoh himself had no reliance except on the magicians in his life's course. This is it.

 we approach with guidance to the Creator, glorified and exalted, from sheep and camels, meaning from livestock in general, they are also have this sacrifice idea and perception. Clear? And this negative mental state in perceiving the matter, as you mentioned, cow or calf , the current and prevailing religion of Moses' people, as manifested in the Samaritan, was embodied in the cow worshipers. Meaning they took the cow as their god. When we say they worship the cow, it's not that everyone worships the cow; among them, there are those who worship fire, among them, there are those who worship multiple perceptions.

 However, there was a group of people who were close to Moses, peace be upon him, meaning it was like the immediate circle around Moses, peace be upon him. This was their veil from knowing God and from Moses. It was their worship that prevailed among them in their ancient tradition , as they took cows as gods. Understand? Just like the Samaritan, this was what was in his heart. So, when our Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, left them and sought seclusion with his Lord, what did the Samaritan do to them? He made for them a calf and said to them, "This is your god and the god of Moses." What does "your god and the god of Moses" mean? Why did Moses include them? Meaning the closest circle to Moses, most of them, before they entered into Islam, used to worship cows. So, it wasn't strange or illogical for them because they were accustomed to it before, understand? They were accustomed before they took this idol in the form of a calf or a cow as their god. So, what did this calf do? Because the issue is that as long as the calf remained motionless, they were accustomed to it and worshiped it for many years, understand? But now, Moses, peace be upon him, had denied them this worship and denied them this divinity in their minds, and clarified to them that the worship of the One God, who is unique, is not like anything else, which is Oneness. But despite that, the effect of what their lower self had become accustomed to and imprinted on them for many years remained. So, what did he do? As if by the footprint of this horse "Gabriel peace be upon him horse" and by the blessing of the permission of Aaron, peace be upon him, this calf made of gold moved, so it moved and bellowed, understand? So, it made a sound, and as long as it made a sound, it was as if it was saying to them, "No, this is a real god because it is alive." Clear or not? Not like what you were accustomed to, not making a sound and so on, clear until now? It means it brought to their minds what had been ingrained in their lower self for many ages. This is the issue.

 When the story of one of Moses people , who was killed occurred , and his matter was concealed, so another person was falsely accused instead of the real killer, And this event occurred between two tribes, or between two known nations, Here Moses, peace be upon him, came with what they were influenced by, understand? Because everything was slaughtered and sacrificed except for the Calf and the cow, as long as the Samaritan acted against them, of course, in his favor. Of course, it became in their minds like a good omen, meaning leave it, "it is ordered", it is like this. So, Moses, peace be upon him, ordered them to slaughter this cow from within themselves, from their hearts, so that the bond of Oneness would be revived in their hearts, and they would return to the Oneness of Allah , glorified and exalted. So, the story came to this consensus, meaning to slaughter and to negate what the soul and lower self had become accustomed to for many ages, understand? So, this is your veil in knowing your Lord, to contradict yourself on what you have become accustomed to and what you considered great, to remove it from your soul, so he brought this cow, and of course, their study, culture, and religion were all about cow worship, many questions arose about it, how is it? What is its type? What is its color? What are its characteristics? Understand? So, our Master Moses, peace be upon him, began to answer and specify the cow for them, of course, with the permission of the Allah , glorified and exalted, so that they could have this image of this cow, which was great in their minds, not just an ordinary cow, understand? Because even this specialization, the specialization they took, doesn't mean it's an ordinary matter. You don't just bring any cow and worship it; this cow had to be a virgin, of course, it didn't do any work whatsoever, it was sacred from its youth, its color was unique so it carried that feature. Even when the Samaritan made this Calf for them, he made it with the same feature that Moses, peace be upon him, specified for the cow, clear ? Did you understand me or not ? 

 Because at that time, the yellow cow was not present in abundance and was not found, so he said it was one unique cow, unlike any other, bright yellow in color, meaning this specialization they knew, so they asked about it. They didn't ask about a specialization they didn't know about, clear? It's as if they were saying, "If we were to bring any cow, regardless of whether we learned Oneness or not, let's bring something great in our hearts and souls, imagining that it is God." Astaghfirullah, that's the greatest veil. So, you have to bring it, so they actually brought it and slaughtered it before them as if giving them the image that it was not created for worship but for slaughter, and the well-known verse in this chapter means it was created for slaughter. And if you slaughtered it, as long as it is Allah commanded you to slaughter it, so they slaughtered it as an offering to Allah. This is real closeness and this is the law "sharia". But if you, for example, raised it and sanctified it in your heart, and did not touch it and let it do whatever it wanted, this contradicts the law of the Lord "sharia". This does not teach you Oneness, but rather this is association and disbelief in Allah. So, he taught them Oneness with this characteristic, on a matter they had become accustomed to, and it had a nature and dignity in their hearts and soul, clear? So, they brought that unique cow, unlike any other, and slaughtered it, and it was just struck with its side, for example, or its shoulder, and it struck the dead, so Allah, glorified and exalted, blow into it from His spirit, so he spoke and revealed the killer, and returned dead instantly, meaning if he had remained alive, he would have been worshiped besides Allah. So they said, "Perhaps what was hidden in this cow has transferred to him," so humans will continueto be worshiped in other ages instead of cows, clear? So this cow or calf had a status among the people of Moses because it was worshiped besides the Lord, clear? So our Lord gave us an example so that even if we deviated from our thoughts and ways, we remember that the cow was created only as cattle to reflect on , slaughter, closeness to Allah, eating, and other purposes, clear? Not for glorifying

. As for the issue of the people of India or America or any other country or people who worship cows, of course, that lineage remains existent to this day, as there are not only people worshiping cows in this era; there are people worshiping fire, stars, and even rats. Don't say they don't exist; they do. There are people who worship rats. This is not something new or a new form of polytheism or disbelief; this existed in the past but remained like a stream, a lineage. Do you understand? Its influence persists to this day, clear? That's what it is. As for saying there is no connection of the Surah to China or India , it's for the people of Moses. Surah Al-Baqarah is considered like the Torah, clear? The story of Surah Al-Baqarah is the same as if someone wants to read the Torah, let them read Surah Al-Baqarah, clear. There are those who, for example, are researching religions, so they search and want to study the Book of the Creator, which is the Torah, right? There's nothing wrong with that; let them not tire themselves; they return to the Quran and read Surah Al-Baqarah because there they read the Torah unaltered, clear. Like this, for example, if someone wants to read the Gospel, and there are many versions of the Gospel, instead of tiring themselves, they read Surah Maryam, clear? For example, they feel as if they've read an unaltered Gospel because the Quran is the compiler of all heavenly books. If we now searched and found an unaltered Gospel, an unaltered Torah, unaltered scrolls, and unaltered tablets, as if we took a divided Quran, instead of calling it Part 15, for example, or Part 20, we call this part the Torah, and this part the Gospel, and this part the Scrolls, clear? And they were compiled for the Chosen One whichis ProphetMuhammad, peace be upon him, because the Prophet said, "I have been given the comprehensive words," meaning the words of Allah are comprehensive, it's the Quran. So Allah compiled all the books and made them available without distortion and alteration. People abandoned the Quran and started searching in cultures and in all the heavenly books, all of which are fake, all made by humans. Some words remained true to their original meaning; you find them similar to the Quran. As for most words or verses, they were indeed altered, so Surah Al-Baqarah remains the slaughter of your greed, disbelief, and polytheism that you associated with your Lord. And if you slaughtered it and scarificed it for allah ? Allah revives your heart and your heart will acknowledges the truth, unifying the Lord of Majesty.

**Question**

Do we have permission to visit the shrines of the spiritual tree?

**Answer**

We've discussed this question before, and you always ask repetitive questions that we have answered previously. I do not prevent anyone from visiting shrines.

If I were to tell a disciple, "No, you have no right to visit shrines," if the disciple hears the sheikh say not to visit shrines then he should not visit them. He wouldn't pack his bag and look for shrines to visit. Instead of preventing him by saying not to visit, if he wants to visit, let him visit. If he wants to sit, let him sit; that's his choice. But we tell him one thing: if you visit the shrines, these are the etiquettes of the visit. We discuss this matter so you achieve the desired result.

However, we do not prevent or cut off this matter. Even Moses did not cut off the Israelites from idol worship. He cut off the sea for them, fed them manna and quail from Allah without any effort, and yet the Samaritan made a golden calf for them, and they began circling around it like the Kaaba and prostrating to it. These were the people of Moses, and not only did he perform “karama” for them, but he also performed miracles 

As for graves, shrines, and the dead, if you wish, take your tent and live there for the rest of your life with them. Do you understand? Sit there, remember Allah, unify Allah, and worship Allah. As long as you are, alhamdullilah, a male and not a female. When it is time for prayer, find a place a bit away from the graves and pray there. Do your daily “wird” at the grave without standing directly on it of course , understood? That's it.

As for the domes placed on the shrines, they are there to indicate and make known over time that the one buried there was a righteous person. Visiting the righteous and saints inherits reflection on what awaits you after death. Or if, for example, you read about a righteous person, learned his virtues and characteristics, knew his story and his writings, loved his life, and visited him to reflect and contemplate that he left countless writings, righteous children “disciples” , and ongoing charities. So you went to this pure place, whose owner was a throne of the Most Merciful. You went with the intention of the verse "Do not consider those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead, rather they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision." Al-imran 169.

You sat in this place intending to pray two rak'ahs of Istikhara and seeking to uncover the hidden secrets in your heart and the noble virtues of that righteous saint, then may Allah bless your visit , I will not come to you and say it is not permissible, that is it.

And if that righteous saint is part of your spiritual tree, it is even closer because you took from a sheikh from a sheikh from a sheikh. He was one of the sheikhs who was a reason and a channel for the divine light to reach your heart because he carried the light of Allah in his heart in a past time. So it is as if you went to him to seek blessings from the chain of transmission and the spiritual tree. Case closed, and glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Glory, above what they describe. Clear?

If this is the intention then may Allah bless it. If there is another intention? You will get nothing at all, unless you go with the conditions that I told you before. If you go and study his virtues and know who he was and what he did—whether he was a mujahid (warrior) or an 'arif (gnostic)—not just any abandoned grave you see and you visit , it will never bring you any results at all. It will only stir emotions in your heart. But if you go to a well-known master & saint of his time, whose books are still being studied, or whose events are still being discussed, there is no problem with that. We visit him after we have read about him and learned his story, or read his books and benefited from some of his advice. It is okay to visit him and pray for his mercy because we consider him our spiritual father since we have taken from him through the spiritual chain. 

However, if you visit a grave or shrine, sit there, and know nothing about him except his name and that he was a righteous saint, it won't benefit you at all. You can sit there for even 1,000 years, and you will return the same person as you came. You will only benefit if you reflect on death and not on the person, thinking about how your own end will be. This will make your soul feel a bit of pain, and your eyes will tear up. This has nothing to do with the person; it is humility and reflection on death. Your relationship with the person should be that you studied him, knew his virtues, and learned his story. That is it.

But if you imagine that visiting a particular shrine will bring you angels or that visiting someone will grant you knowledge, you will not gain even a letter of knowledge! Just now we were talking about cows, and the saying goes, "The dead cow does not give milk." That is it. His deeds have ceased unless he left behind a righteous child who prays for him, and maybe you were influenced by one of his children or one of his disciples. Or he left beneficial knowledge, and you were influenced by his books, so you visited him, and that's it. But taking your bag and starting to visit shrines won't benefit you. Instead of visiting shrines, lay out your prayer mat and make dhikr ; this will benefit you more. Understand?

And if you see the poor “fuqara” wandering around shrines, it is not as you think. They visit shrines that follow our spiritual chain & spiritual tree or are close to us. As the disciple does this journey for the sake of Allah so he considers them as stations, because he cannot go on a long wandering continuously so that's why we made these stations. These stops at shrines or mosques , we consider them as the starting or ending points to complete the wandering.
That's it.

Bismillah.

**Question**

I heard from one of the disciples that you said the Mahdi is alive in our time and that he is young. Does that mean we will face Dajjal “the Antichrist” in our lifetime? 
How should we prepare for this confrontation with dajjal ?
Should we go to specific places that will protect us from this trial?

**Answer**

I said that he is alive, but I did not say that he is young. I didn't specify his age, understood? Regarding his birth, I said that he is born now if we calculate the time specified by Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, in the hadiths, it indicates that our current time is when our Master the Mahdi, peace be upon him, has emerged into the sensory world “a'alam al-hiss”. Whether he is a year old, two years old, a month or two months old, or 20 or 30 years old, only God knows. This is what I said.

As for whether we will live until the time of dajjal or not, Allah knows, and lifespans are in Allah hands. I don't even know about myself whether I will see tomorrow or die; only Allah knows the appointed time of our death. Understood? This is one point.

If God prolongs a person’s life until, for example, they reach 80 or 90 years old, then we can reasonably say that perhaps they will face this confrontation with dajjal , or maybe one of their children or grandchildren will. Because if we say now, not much time is left, this is one point.

How do we deal with the dajjal ?
The Prophet, peace be upon him, informed us to fortify ourselves with Surah Al-Kahf weekly and to memorize the first 10 verses. Whenever we suspect someone, whether they are the dajjal himself or using some form of deceit “dajal” , we recite the first 10 verses of Surah Al-Kahf to them. We commit to reading Surah Al-Kahf in its entirety every Friday or Friday night. So how do we confront him? With piety and the Quran, and by returning to God and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Clear ?

I will not tell you to pack your bags and go to a certain country to escape dajjal. Wherever you go, you will face him. He will tread on every piece of land except two places: Mecca and Medina. Even if you go and stay in the heart of the Kaaba or the heart of the Prophet’s mosque “rawda sharefa”, when dajjal stands on their outskirts and calls out, if you have any percentage of hypocrisy or distance from God in your heart, it is not him who enters, but you who will go out to meet and greet him. So, don't tire yourself by thinking you can escape him by being in a certain place, no.

Conversely, Surah Al-Kahf, with God’s power and ability, will save you from him even if you are in a land of disbelief “kufr”. If you always intend to fortify and protect yourself from him by reciting Surah Al-Kahf weekly and the first 10 verses of Surah Al-Kahf whenever you suspect someone, then you are following the Prophet’s hadith, peace be upon him. But if you neglect this matter and this weapon and just go to a place that you know is pure and where dajjal does not tread and stay there, you will indeed be liberated, but you must add what we said, which is the Surah and the verses. Because if you don't add the Surah and the verses, and you remain in hypocrisy, knowing the truth and not applying it, showing a face to the truth and another to disbelief "kufr” , then dajjal will draw you out with his voice, even if you are in the heart of the Kaaba, and that will be the end of the matter. 
Understood?

Bismillah.

**Question**

I had a vision “dream”, Sidi Sheikh. I saw it in 2021 while reading the Wird for blessing before the pact “baya'a”. I saw myself in the Karkariya zawiya, specifically in the kitchen, and it was dark. I was crying intensely, saying that I would not become a disciple of the Sheikh. Then, one of the disciples came to me and said that the Sheikh was waiting for me or wanted to meet me. So, I went with the disciple to meet you, Sidi Sheikh, and you told me to wait a bit because someone had come before me. I waited for about half an hour, and then you came to me, Sidi Sheikh, and placed your right hand on my eyes. I saw the universe filled with lights, and then something like a circular cancer growth came out of my back. You placed your thumb on this cancer, and demons and evil spirits came out of it. I woke up from the vision feeling happy and at peace.

**Answer**

So, alhamdulillah for the blessing of His light and the blessing of Islam, and that is enough of a blessing. He was a polytheist “mushrik”, and when we say he was a polytheist or a disbeliever or non-Muslim, we mean all those who disbelieved in what the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him brought and what Allah Almighty sent down, yet they still have a trace of Islam in their hearts to testify against them on the Day of Judgment. Allah created them on the natural disposition (fitra) of Islam. This fitra remains present, but as we always say, it is the parents who make their child Jewish or Christian based on what they follow and practice in their lives. They formed in him this cancer and this tyrant “taghout”. Clear?

He says that in 2021, he took the blessing Wird. He indeed took it, but not with the intention of seeking blessing; rather, he heard the disciples talking about the light of Allah, and his curiosity was piqued. But Allah, as He guides whom He wills, made him instead of just reading or listening to what the brothers were saying, he became better than the brothers because he searched for the connecting thread, which is the Wird, and used it, unlike some. Because reading about something is one thing, but searching for the way that led someone to that rank and organizing your own connection with your Lord to reach what the speaker reached? That is another thing; this is actual application. So, this is what he did.

When he began to enter the circle of Dhikr, Allah did not leave him. If Allah, the Exalted, had left him, He would not have sent him this connection in the first place, which was the cause of bringing him from darkness into light. Clear? So he read this Wird and found himself in closeness, and at the same time, he was close because he was in the zawiya and in the kitchen, but still not a Muslim, of course, and his thoughts were still controlling him, so he needed a certain period. Clear?

This certain period, according to calculation, was just half an hour, as the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: "I and the Hour have been sent like these two" (raising his index and middle fingers). Meaning, half of his life that passed in darkness, if he has the coming half, we pray that it will be light. So, the first half of his life was settled in the kitchen, and what is always in the kitchen? Food and drink only. Without the blessing of Islam, a human is animalistic—food, drink, and mating are his goals. Clear?

So, as long as he was at that time focused only on food, earning money, and food, we told him to wait half an hour. This half hour by a hidden calculation, not a physical one, constituted this period until 2024. Clear? So, when he continued reading, he found that this dark veil below was a cancer, and always in our time, cancer is like the plague in past times, and the plague is a prick or tingle from the jinn. 
Clear?

Even now, what is the cause of cancer? Others of this era attribute the main cause of cancer to food; it is not from food, it is from darkness. This pricking or tingling done by Jinn “shaytan”,if prolonged in yourself for long time like major sins, drinking, adultery and so on, it begins to grow and expand in the body until it becomes cancer as it is now. 
That's it.
 Clear?

So this cancer formed and came out of his back, and the Sheikh placed his thumb on his back. The thumb means we seal with it “khatm” , that's it. It substitutes for a signature or signing nowadays, meaning the signing with fingers is what is still valid and remains valid in most countries today. Even in our countries now, the signature alone is not sufficient in important official transactions; you must stamp with your thumb to be identified.

So The Sheikh's stamp on what he accumulated since his birth from polytheism and disbelief purifies him by Allah Almighty and brings him from darkness to light. This is the Prophet Muhammad said, peace be upon him, and you always know it: "I have left among you the Book of Allah and my family (Ahlul Bayt)" and the other hadith: "Whoever shakes hands with me or shakes hands with the one who shakes hands with me, the fire will not touch him." And all these are authentic hadiths established by the Prophet, peace be upon him. They are not approved except for those who oppose of ahlul albait or oppose the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him.

And now, alhamdulillah, he has declared his Islam and he knows his rights and responsibilities, and things are becoming clearer for him more and more. We pray to Allah Almighty to purify us and him completely so that he becomes pleasing to Allah and the Prophet, peace be upon him, in this world and the Hereafter, 
and that's it.

We didn't do anything; even the sentence "I met with the Sheikh," he thinks meeting the Sheikh is when he traveled and came to see me , no. Everyone who came, we met in past times and in earlier centuries. Allah Almighty now brought the bodies, and the spirits came together before the bodies. Now the coming together of the bodies is merely to affirm what the spirits came together for in the past, to bring it down to the tangible “a'alam alhiss” so that our souls can be at ease and say indeed we visited, we took, we got closer, and so on.
whether in closeness or in distance and separation. Even those who opposed the sainthood opposed it in the past, even those who hypocritically treated the sainthood hypocritically did so in the past. Allah brought them now to affirm the matter, and it becomes a testimony for or against them.

That is why we are at ease; you came, took the pact, and broke it, or you came, took the pact, and remained steadfast; it is the same to us because we know we did nothing, it is Allah who brought you. As long as Allah wanted good for you, He kept you firm on His light, light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. Allah wanted to guide you to His light, so He brought you to a cause and a gate of light, and that's it.

Of course, if you are not from this group and are from the other group who want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, meaning they know this light and want to extinguish it with falsehoods, temptations, what displeases Allah and His Messenger and His saint , peace be upon them all, this is it.

And Allah will perfecte his light “wallah motim norih” (surat alsaf 9)
So, we are calm and comfortable; whether you do or not do, it doesn't add or subtract anything from the container. We are not overjoyed by your coming, nor are we sad at your departure; the matter is the same to us.

You set up a test, meaning you want to test yourself, so Allah sends you a Prophet if you are in the time of the Prophets, or a Messenger if you are in the time of the Messengers, or a Saint if you are in the time of the Sainthood, or an Imam if you are in the time of the Imams, or a scholar if you are in the time of the scholars, so that he is a witness for or against you. And as all the righteous say: "Scholars were sent as a witnesses against the nation, and Saints were sent as a witnesses against the scholars," even they need someone to be a witness against them.
That's it.

That is why you always find scholars in conflict with Saints, except those whom the Lord has mercy on, so they can testify against them on the Day of Judgment. 
That's it.

Because he comes with an interpretation of a hadith or a verse in a way he imagines to be scientific and comprehensive, so a Saint is sent to confound him in this matter, as was sent to Moses, peace be upon him. Moses, was a scholar above scholars, a Prophet and a Messenger and one of the steadfast “ou'lu ala'azm”, and a righteous servant was sent to him “al-khidir” . Clear? So that he is a proof for or against him. 
That's it.

Bismillah.
