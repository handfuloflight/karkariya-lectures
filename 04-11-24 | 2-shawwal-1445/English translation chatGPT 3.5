I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.
Guide us on the Straight Path,
the path of those who have received Your grace;
not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves,
nor of those who have gone astray.

O Allah, bless our Master Muhammad and the family of our Master Muhammad, as You blessed our Master Ibrahim and the family of our Master Ibrahim. And grant peace and blessings upon our Master Muhammad and the family of our Master Muhammad, as You granted peace and blessings upon our Master Ibrahim and the family of our Master Ibrahim, in all the worlds. You are worthy of all praise and glory. Glory be to Your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, above what they describe, and peace be upon the messengers. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Allah.
Allah.
Allah.
Allah.
And there is no power or strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.

**Question**:
My Sheikh, as I perform the wird with closed eyes and focus in the center as you instructed me, flashes of light come to me from the right, left, above, and below. Is this the light ?

**Answer**:
Everything is light from Allah because it's all signs and indications from Allah. We focus on the center, which is the qibla "direction of prayer" to reach the example of the Divine Light. It comes from wherever it wills, as the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: 'Light to my right, light to my left, light above me, light below me.' This considered a light in non-delimitation realm. We must restrain it with reason. 'Reason it and trust.'
 for Allah, the Almighty, reasons it for us in the quaternary example. The fastest pace and behavior "sulook" is to try to surpass these directions and focus on one direction, which is the qibla "direction of the prayer" or the center. In fact, it's not the center; it's the front or your orientation.

In the story of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, Allah says: 'And I have directed my face towards He who created the heavens and the earth.' So at that moment, you receive the example directly and the matter becomes faster. Once you understand the example , do not lean towards any direction. Thus, we tell the seeker in the beginning of their journey to close their eyes to surpass and avoid these directions because you define these directions yourself, with your presence, and by looking at yourself. Therefore, the Lord says, 'And remember your Lord when you forget.' If you forget yourself, remember Allah; your gonna be fast in dhikir , near , But human is accustomed to opening his eyes and seeing these directions. Even if he closes his eyes, he still senses his presence and determines. So we say close your eyes so there's no right or left, no above or below; only your direction remains. This is why we say to the seeker: close your eyes until you overcome these directions. However, for 40, 50, or 70 years, he has been defining these directions by his existence. Even if he closes his eyes, he still sees his presence and thinks he exists, so he continues to define these directions. This is the problem. As long as he defines, he imagines that it comes from the right or left, but in fact, it comes from his orientation. As long as he defines these directions, he sees right and left. We choose the center for him and say: this is your direction. All of this is his direction 'in front of him.' So Allah says in Surah Al-Hadid, 'On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right.' This is all direction; there's no longer left. This is between your hands; it is the same as your right 'sidi Sheikh raised both his arms to his side'. But this is difficult; detaching oneself from something accustomed is difficult. No one closes their eyes and surpasses these directions in their thoughts forever. Even if he's been 20 years on the path, he still closes his eyes and thinks, 'This is right, and this is left.' When you close your eyes, what do you see? As if you see a tablet, it's your direction, and that's it. But your thoughts always define. So, I come and say: search for the source.
 as long as you have a problem with yourself, a problem with the selfishness of your existence. At least swim, dive in, enter; perhaps you'll lose these directions. Clear?"
